# Windows PowerShell is an evolution of the command line – a combination of a DOS shell and scripting environment. 
- It can help with repetitive tasks; processes acting on many files at once; automating and scheduling tasks; and configuring Windows components and services. PowerShell is not only for running DOS commands, it is far more flexible than that. 
- It supports complex decision making, connecting to a wide variety of data sources, and even building graphical user interfaces.

# PowerShell is now an essential skill for IT and server administrators, and is often used when deploying maintenance scripts across an entire organization. 
- Getting those scripts to run safely on all machines can be a technical process, but tips and help are available for PowerShell users working with Enterprise Desktop machines. Despite the focus on administrative tasks, home users and software developers can often save time by making use of the facilities available.
